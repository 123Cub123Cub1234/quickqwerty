    <p>
    <a href="http://quickqwerty.com/">QuickQWERTY</a> is a touch typing
    tutor written by <a href="http://susam.in/">Susam Pal</a>. This
    software may be used to train your fingers to type without looking
    at the keys.  After completing all the units available in this
    software, one would know the location of the keys on the keyboard
    through muscle memory, and would be able to effortlessly use the
    right finger for each key.
    </p>

    <h2>Units</h2>

    <p>
    The typing lessons available in this software are divided into units
    and subunits. Each unit introduces a new set of keys to be
    practiced. For example, the first unit trains the fingers on how to
    press the keys in the home row. A couple of new keys are introduced
    with every new unit.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each unit is divided into five subunits:
    </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Grip: Getting used to the keys</li>
    <li>Words: Learning to type words</li>
    <li>Control: Learning to stop abruptly in the middle of words</li>
    <li>Sentences: Learning to type sentences</li>
    <li>Test: Testing your proficiency level in the current unit</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    One should move to the next lesson only after completing the current
    lesson satisfactorily. When a lesson is completed satisfactorily,
    the software suggests you to move to the next lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
    While typing one should look at the computer monitor only. Fingers
    should always be placed on the home row as indicated in the first unit.
    If any key outside the home row has to be typed, one should return the
    finger to the home row immediately after striking that key.
    </p>

    <h2>5–6 split vs. 6–7 split</h2>

    <p>
    There are two popular ways to type the ten number keys on the top
    row.
    </p>

    <ol>
    <li>In a nontraditional style, '1' is typed with the little finger of
     the left hand, '2' is typed with the ring finger of the left hand,
     '5' is typed with the forefinger of the left hand and '6' is typed
     with the forefinger of the right hand. Thus, the number keys are
     split at 5–6 between the left hand and the right hand.</li>
    <li>In the traditional style, '1' and '2' are typed with the little
     finger of the left hand, '6' is typed with the forefinger of the
     left hand and '7' is typed with the forefinger of the right hand.
     In other words, the number keys are split at 6–7 between the left
     hand and the right hand.</li>
    </ol><p>In most keyboards, the '6' key is located closer to the 'F' key. As a
    result, the '6' key is more accessible to the left hand than the right
    hand. Therefore, many people prefer the traditional style with 6–7
    split. However, there are also many people who prefer the nontraditional
    style with 5–6 split. Which style you choose depends on your taste,
    convenience and the kind of keyboard you have. If you are confused about
    which style to choose, choose the traditional style with 6–7 split.</p>

    <p>This software supports both styles for the number keys. In units 16–19
    which involve the number keys, a link appears below the practice area to
    switch between the two styles. </p>
